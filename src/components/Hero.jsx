        Recently, I’ve worked as a Full Stack Developer at Kairos, where I’ve
        been contributing to decentralized finance projects by building a
        decentralized exchange (DEX) with TypeScript and React. My work involves
        both frontend and backend development, ensuring seamless user
        experiences in the Web3 environment.

        Previously, I’ve had the opportunity to develop software for companies
        of different scales, from start-ups to established tech firms, including
        Jobandtalent. I have implemented CI/CD pipelines, developed
        microservices, and applied architectural patterns like Hexagonal
        Architecture to improve modularity and efficiency.

      <p className="sm:text-sm  mb-6">
        Outside of work, I’m often exploring new tech trends, contributing to
        open-source projects, and staying active through hiking and reading.
